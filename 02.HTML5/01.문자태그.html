    <p id="id1" class="paragraph">  Lorem Ipsum   is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.  <br>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,  <br>
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p> <br>
    <p id="id2">  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,  <br>
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of  <br>
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,  </p>
         <br>
    <p id="id3">  and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
